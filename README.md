# Nika.Design Portfolio 🎨

A stunning, glassmorphism-inspired portfolio website built for a UX Designer. 

This project was crafted with ❤️ as a gift for my friend [Nika](https://www.facebook.com/sunngodnikaa) to showcase her work, while also serving as a playground for me to level up my own frontend development skills.

## ✨ Live Demo

Check out the live site here: **[nikaaa.vercel.app](https://nikaaa.vercel.app)**

## 🚀 Features

*   **Glassmorphism UI**: A modern, frosted-glass aesthetic with fluid background animations and ambient lighting.
*   **Bilingual Support (ENG/KHM)**: Instant language switching between English and Khmer, with automatic font adjustment (using *Kantumruy Pro* & *Battambong* for Khmer).
*   **Interactive Vibes Player**: A fully functional custom music player featuring "Pistol" by Cigarettes After Sex, complete with seeking and real-time progress text.
*   **Responsive Design**: Flawlessly adapts to web and mobile screens.
*   **Dark/Light Mode**: (Coming soon/Architecture ready) - The structural CSS variables are set up for easy theming.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **React**: Core framework for component-based architecture.
*   **CSS3**: Custom vanilla CSS for complex glassmorphism effects, animations, and gradients (no hefty frameworks).
*   **React Context API**: Used for global state management of the Language Switcher.
*   **Lucide React**: For beautiful, lightweight feather icons.

## 💡 The Story Behind

I wanted to challenge myself to build something that wasn't just functional, but *felt* distinctive. The goal was to capture Nika's personality—creative, empathetic, and detail-oriented—translated into code. 

**Key learnings during this build:**
*   Mastering `backdrop-filter` and layered shadows for depth.
*   Handling multiple fonts and languages dynamically in React.
*   Building custom media controls with the HTML5 Audio API.
